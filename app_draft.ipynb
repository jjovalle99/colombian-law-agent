Todos estos valores siguen siendo esenciales en el Estado constitucional del Derecho y una sociedad democrática y respetuosa de los derechos y libertades, requiere de la existencia y garantía de tales instituciones. Tampoco se trata de sentar una doctrina que avala una suerte de “dictadura de los periodistas”, privilegiados sin límites de expresarse e informar sin responsabilidad ninguna y sin soporte razonable en la realidad, pues un tal ejercicio de esas libertades preferentes, sería contrario a la lógica y armonía que requiere el sistema de derechos y en general, el orden constitucional.

       "La territorialidad es un concepto amplio que se aplica en varias disciplinas, incluyendo la psicología, la sociología, la antropología, la geografía, y el derecho, entre otras. Aunque tiene distintas connotaciones en cada campo, en general, la territorialidad se refiere a la manera en que los individuos y los grupos establecen control, influencia o dominio sobre un espacio o territorio específico. Este concepto implica no solo la ocupación física de un espacio, sino también la delimitación de ese espacio a través de límites simbólicos o legales, la defensa del mismo contra intrusos, y la personalización o modificación del espacio para reflejar la identidad o las necesidades de quien lo controla.\n",

       "En el ámbito humano, la territorialidad puede manifestarse de muchas maneras, desde la propiedad personal de bienes (como una casa o un coche) hasta la ocupación y control de grandes extensiones de tierra por parte de estados o naciones. También se observa en contextos más pequeños, como la disposición de los espacios en oficinas o la selección de asientos en espacios públicos, reflejando deseos de privacidad, control y comunicación social.\n",
